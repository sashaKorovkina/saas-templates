## Pricing Models
The logic for this will be that the template is driven by the pricing model on its backend.

1. **Subscription-based:** Users pay a recurring fee (monthly or annually) for access to the service.
2. **Pay-per-use:** Users are charged based on their usage of the service or resources.
3. **Freemium:** Basic features are free, with premium features available for a fee.
4. **Tiered pricing:** Different pricing tiers offer varying levels of features or usage limits.
5. **Paywalls:** Content or features are hidden and unlocked only after payment.
6. **Usage-based (Metered):** Costs depend on usage metrics, such as API calls or storage.
7. **Free trial:** Users access the full service for a limited time before deciding to pay.
8. **Action-based:** Users perform a specific action for free a limited number of times before it becomes paid.

Hence for each one, we need a template.
